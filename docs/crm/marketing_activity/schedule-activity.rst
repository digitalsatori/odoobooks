Scheduled Activities in Odoo
============================

Overview
--------

Scheduled Activities in Odoo allow users to plan, organize, and track
various tasks and actions directly linked to records within Odoo's
comprehensive suite of business applications. This feature is designed
to enhance productivity, ensure follow-ups, and streamline operations
across departments. From setting reminders for a sales call in the CRM
to scheduling a project meeting in the Project app, Scheduled Activities
are integral to keeping your team aligned and focused.

Getting Started
---------------

This feature is crucial for managing tasks, meetings, calls, and other
scheduled actions that contribute to the workflow and productivity of a
business.

Accessing Scheduled Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scheduled Activities can be accessed from most records in Odoo
applications. They are typically found as a clock icon or a tab within a
record, indicating the presence of planned activities.

Creating a Scheduled Activity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Navigate to the Record: Open the record (e.g., a CRM lead, a project
      task) where you want to schedule an activity.

   ..

      Schedule an Activity: Look for the "Schedule Activity" button or
      link. Click on it to open the activity scheduling dialog.

      Fill in the Details:

   -  Activity Type: Select the type of activity (e.g., Call, Email,
         Meeting).

   -  Summary: Provide a brief description of the activity.

   -  Due Date: Choose when the activity should be completed.

   -  Assigned to: Assign the activity to a user.

   -  Tags (optional): Add tags for better organization (if applicable).

   -  Notes (optional): Add any relevant notes or instructions.

Managing Scheduled Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Viewing Activities: Activities can be viewed in the activity tab or
      summary area of the record. They can also be seen in the user's
      dashboard.

-  Editing Activities: Click on an activity to edit its details (e.g.,
      reschedule, change assignee).

-  Marking as Done: Once completed, activities can be marked as done,
      which archives them for record-keeping and removes them from the
      active list.

Automation and Integration
--------------------------

Activities are integrated with all the objects.

Automated Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Odoo allows for the automation of activity scheduling through server
actions or automated actions within the settings of each application.
These can be set to trigger based on specific criteria, such as a stage
change in a lead or a deadline approaching for a task.

Integration with Calendar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scheduled Activities in Odoo seamlessly integrate with the Odoo
Calendar, allowing users to have a holistic view of their tasks and
appointments. Activities scheduled in records will automatically appear
in the user's calendar, providing a unified schedule across all
applications.

Best Practices
--------------

-  Consistency in Activity Types: Use consistent activity types across
      your organization to ensure clarity and uniformity in tracking and
      reporting.

-  Regular Review: Regularly review upcoming and overdue activities to
      ensure tasks are being completed and to reschedule or adjust
      priorities as necessary.

-  Leverage Automation: Utilize automated actions to reduce manual
      scheduling of recurring or follow-up activities.

Conclusion
----------

Scheduled Activities in Odoo are a powerful tool for managing your daily
tasks and ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks. By integrating
activities with your workflow, you can enhance communication, increase
efficiency, and improve overall productivity within your organization.
