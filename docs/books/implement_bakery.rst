Chapter 1: Introduction to Odoo for the Bakery Industry
**********************************************************

This chapter introduces Odoo as a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution uniquely suited for the bakery industry. It outlines the platform's core benefits, maps typical bakery workflows to Odoo's integrated applications, and provides a strategic overview for the implementation journey ahead.

1.1 Why Odoo is a Recipe for Success in the Bakery Business
============================================================

The modern bakery is a complex business, blending artistry with the demands of retail, manufacturing, and logistics. Success requires more than just delicious products; it demands operational excellence. From managing the shelf life of fresh ingredients to handling a rush of morning customers and fulfilling large catering orders, bakeries face unique challenges that can strain disconnected or manual systems.[1] As a bakery grows, these inefficiencies compound, leading to stock wastage, production delays, and a diminished customer experience.[1]

Odoo addresses these challenges by providing a single, unified platform to manage every facet of a bakery's operations. This integrated approach is Odoo's fundamental advantage, eliminating the data silos that arise when using separate systems for point of sale, inventory, online orders, and accounting.[2, 3, 4]

The core benefits of adopting Odoo for a bakery business include:

    *   **Scalability**: Odoo's modular design is a key asset for businesses of all sizes. A small artisanal shop can begin with a lean setup, perhaps using only the **Point of Sale (POS)**, **Invoicing**, and **Inventory** apps. As the business expands to include wholesale clients or an online store, it can seamlessly add the **Sales**, **eCommerce**, and **Manufacturing** applications. This "expand as you grow" philosophy ensures the system evolves with the business, making it a sustainable long-term investment.[1, 5]
    *   **Centralized Data**: All information—from a single croissant sold at the counter to a bulk purchase of flour—is captured in a central database. This creates a single source of truth, enabling real-time visibility across the entire operation. Managers can access accurate reports on sales performance, inventory levels, and production costs instantly, empowering data-driven decision-making rather than relying on guesswork.[4, 6] Case studies show that this real-time data access improves accuracy in stock management and overall operational efficiency.[7, 8]
    *   **Automation**: Odoo excels at automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks. For instance, reordering rules in the Inventory app can automatically generate draft purchase orders when ingredient stock falls below a set threshold, preventing costly stock-outs.[5] Sales at the POS automatically deduct from inventory counts, and financial entries are generated without manual intervention. This automation reduces the administrative burden on staff, minimizes human error, and allows the team to focus on high-value activities like customer service and product quality.[1, 9]

1.2 Overview of Key Business Flows: From Flour to Final Sale
=============================================================

To understand how Odoo functions as an integrated system, it is helpful to visualize the primary end-to-end business flows within a bakery. Odoo connects these distinct yet interdependent processes into a cohesive whole.

    *   **Procure-to-Pay**: This flow covers the entire process of acquiring raw materials. It begins with identifying the need for an ingredient (e.g., flour, sugar, butter), creating a purchase order, receiving the goods into inventory, verifying the supplier's invoice, and finally, making the payment.
    *   **Plan-to-Produce**: This is the core manufacturing process. It involves planning the daily baking schedule based on demand, managing recipes (Bills of Materials), issuing manufacturing orders, tracking the consumption of raw materials, and registering the finished baked goods into inventory.
    *   **Order-to-Cash (Retail)**: This is the most visible flow, representing daily in-store operations. It involves a customer selecting items, the cashier processing the transaction through the Point of Sale, accepting payment, and the system automatically updating inventory and financial records.
    *   **Order-to-Cash (Wholesale/Catering)**: This flow handles larger, often recurring, orders from other businesses like cafes, restaurants, or for corporate events. It starts with creating a quotation, converting it to a sales order upon confirmation, managing the delivery of goods, and invoicing the client on specific payment terms.
    *   **Order-to-Cash (Online)**: This flow manages sales through the bakery's website. It includes the customer placing an order online, selecting a fulfillment option (e.g., in-store pickup or local delivery), making an online payment, and the bakery staff fulfilling and dispatching the order.

1.3 Mapping Bakery Processes to Odoo Applications
===================================================

The true power of Odoo lies in how its individual applications work together to manage the business flows described above. A bakery owner or implementation consultant must understand which part of the software solves which specific business problem. Simply listing Odoo's apps is insufficient; they must be contextualized within the bakery's daily workflow. The following table provides a clear roadmap, linking common bakery processes to their corresponding Odoo applications. This mapping serves as a high-level gap analysis and justifies the selection of each module discussed throughout this guide, aligning the technology directly with business needs as emphasized in the Odoo implementation methodology.[10, 11]

***********************************************
Chapter 2: The Odoo Implementation Methodology
***********************************************

A successful Odoo implementation is not merely a software installation; it is a structured business transformation project. Adhering to a proven methodology is the key to delivering the project on time, within budget, and ensuring it meets the bakery's strategic goals. This chapter outlines the official Odoo implementation methodology, tailored to the specific context of a bakery business.

2.1 The Phased Approach to Success
==================================

A structured, phased approach ensures that all aspects of the implementation are addressed logically and sequentially, minimizing risks and maximizing the chances of success. The project is broken down into five distinct phases, each with clear objectives and deliverables.[10]

    *   **Phase 1: Pre-Implementation (Discovery & Planning)**: This is the foundational phase and is critical for setting the project's direction.[10] It begins with a series of workshops involving key stakeholders from the bakery—such as the owner, head baker, lead cashier, and administrative staff. The goal is to gather detailed requirements by understanding their current processes, identifying pain points (e.g., "We frequently run out of whole wheat flour," "Tracking custom cake orders is chaotic"), and defining clear business goals for the new system.[10] The output of this phase is a detailed Project Scope Document that outlines the specific Odoo modules to be implemented and the processes they will cover.

    *   **Phase 2: Implementation (Configuration & Customization)**: With a clear plan in place, this phase involves the hands-on configuration of the Odoo system. The implementation consultant will set up the core modules, configure company-specific settings, import master data (products, customers, vendors), and build out the workflows defined in the scope document.[10] Any required customizations that go beyond Odoo's standard functionality are also developed and deployed during this phase.

    *   **Phase 3: Testing (Validation & Refinement)**: Before the system can go live, it must be rigorously tested to ensure it is free of critical bugs and meets all business requirements.[10] This phase includes several layers of testing:
        *   **Unit Testing**: Each individual module is tested to ensure its functions work as expected (e.g., confirming that a new product can be created in the Inventory app).
        *   **Integration Testing**: This verifies that the modules work together seamlessly. For example, a test would confirm that a sale processed in the POS correctly updates stock levels in the Inventory app and creates the corresponding journal entries in the Accounting app.[10]
        *   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: This is the most critical testing step. Key users from the bakery team are given access to the test system and asked to run through their real-world, day-to-day scenarios (e.g., "Process a sale with a custom cake order," "Receive a shipment of flour from a supplier"). Their feedback is used to make final adjustments and refinements before launch.[10]

    *   **Phase 4: Deployment (Go-Live)**: This is the official launch when the bakery transitions from its old systems to Odoo for its daily operations. The go-live is a carefully planned event that includes final data migration (e.g., importing current inventory counts and open invoices), user account finalization, and on-site support from the implementation team to handle any immediate issues or questions from users.[10]

    *   **Phase 5: Post-Implementation (Support & Improvement)**: The project does not end at go-live.[14] This final phase is crucial for ensuring long-term success. It involves providing continuous training to users to help them master the system, offering ongoing technical support to resolve issues, and planning for future improvements. As the bakery's needs evolve, Odoo's modularity allows for the system to be enhanced with new features or applications over time.[10]

2.2 Choosing the Right Methodology: Agile, Waterfall, or Hybrid
================================================================

Within the phased approach, a project management methodology governs how the work is executed. The choice of methodology depends on the project's complexity and the clarity of its requirements.[15]

While a traditional **Waterfall** methodology—where all requirements are defined upfront and the project proceeds in a linear sequence—can be effective for simple projects with very clear and stable requirements, it lacks the flexibility to accommodate changes.[15] Conversely, a pure **Agile** methodology, which uses short, iterative cycles (sprints) to develop and refine the system based on continuous feedback, is highly adaptable but can sometimes lack the initial structure needed for a core ERP deployment.[15]

For most bakery implementations, a **Hybrid Methodology** offers the best of both worlds. This approach combines the structure of Waterfall for foundational elements with the flexibility of Agile for more dynamic and user-facing components.
    *   **Waterfall for the Foundation**: The initial setup of the system—such as configuring the Chart of Accounts, setting up company data, defining warehouse locations, and migrating core master data—is well-defined and unlikely to change. Using a Waterfall approach for these tasks provides a predictable and stable foundation for the project.
    *   **Agile for the Workflows**: The configuration of modules like the Point of Sale, eCommerce store, and Manufacturing processes often benefits from an iterative approach. Bakery owners and staff may not fully grasp all their needs until they see the system in action. Using Agile sprints allows the implementation team to deliver functionality in small increments, gather feedback from the bakery team, and make adjustments. This is particularly useful for refining the POS button layout, testing new promotion rules, or tweaking recipe costing in the BoM.[1, 16]

This hybrid model provides a structured roadmap while leaving room for the necessary adjustments and optimizations, making it the most effective strategy for implementing Odoo in a dynamic business environment like a bakery.[15]

2.3 Assembling Your Project Team
=================================

A successful implementation requires a dedicated and well-defined project team with clear roles and responsibilities on both the client (bakery) and partner (consultant) sides. Odoo's methodology emphasizes direct communication and clear decision-making channels to keep projects moving efficiently.[11, 14]

    **Odoo Partner Roles**:
    *   **Project Leader**: This is the central figure from the implementation partner. The Project Leader is more than just a project manager; they are also a business analyst and a product expert. Their primary responsibility is to keep the project on time and on budget by defining the project plan, managing customer expectations, configuring the system, and ensuring solutions remain as simple and standard as possible.[11, 14]
    *   **Developer**: This role is responsible for any technical customizations or integrations that are identified as necessary during the planning phase.

    **Bakery Client Roles**:
    *   **Single Point of Contact (SPoC)**: This is the most critical role on the client's side. The SPoC is the primary decision-maker for the bakery and the main liaison with the Odoo Project Leader. This role is typically filled by the business owner or a general manager. Having a single, empowered SPoC is essential to accelerate the decision-making cycle and avoid project delays caused by conflicting feedback.[11, 14]
    *   **Key Users**: These are employees who are experts in their specific domains and will be the primary users of the new system. Examples include the head baker (for Manufacturing), the lead cashier (for POS), and the office manager (for Accounting). They play a vital role in defining requirements during the discovery phase and are the main participants in User Acceptance Testing (UAT).[14]
    *   **Sponsor**: The Sponsor is typically the CEO or owner who is funding the project. They are involved in high-level decisions, track the project's success against its strategic objectives, and are often part of a steering committee on larger projects.[14]

Part 2: Core Configuration and Setup
#####################################

*******************************
Chapter 3: Initial System Setup
*******************************

Before diving into specific business workflows, a set of foundational configurations must be completed. This chapter covers the initial steps of installing the necessary applications, setting up core company information, and establishing user access controls. These steps create the essential framework upon which the entire bakery management system will be built.

3.1 Installing the Essential Bakery Apps
=========================================

The first practical step in any Odoo implementation is to install the required applications. Odoo's modularity means you only install what you need, keeping the system lean and focused. For a typical bakery that handles in-store sales, wholesale orders, online presence, and in-house production, the following suite of apps is recommended as a starting point.[5, 12]

To install apps, navigate to the main **Apps** menu from the Odoo dashboard. Use the search bar to find and install each of the following:
    *   Point of Sale
    *   Sales
    *   Purchase
    *   Inventory
    *   Manufacturing
    *   Invoicing
    *   Accounting
    *   Website
    *   eCommerce

.. image:: /images/chapter3/app_dashboard.png
   :alt: Odoo Apps Dashboard showing essential bakery apps installed.

Each app provides a specific set of functionalities, and their true power is realized through their seamless integration. For example, a sale in the Point of Sale app will automatically trigger actions in Inventory, Invoicing, and Accounting.

3.2 Configuring Company Information
===================================

Once the applications are installed, the next step is to configure the bakery's master data. This information will be used across the system on documents such as quotations, purchase orders, and invoices.

Navigate to **Settings -> General Settings**. Under the **Companies** section, click on **Update Info**. Here, you will configure:
    *   **Company Details**: The legal name, address, phone number, email, and website of the bakery.
    *   **General Information**: Set the company's currency (e.g., USD, EUR). This will be the default currency for all financial transactions.
    *   **Tax Information**: Enter the company's tax ID (e.g., VAT number, EIN). This is crucial for tax calculation and reporting.[17]

Next, it is essential to configure the fiscal periods for accounting. Navigate to the **Accounting** app and go to **Configuration -> Settings**. Here, you can define the **Fiscal Year**, which typically aligns with the calendar year but can be adjusted based on the bakery's financial reporting schedule. This is also where you would later import opening balances to establish the starting financial position of the company in Odoo.[18]

3.3 Setting Up Users, Roles, and Access Rights
================================================

Proper user management is fundamental to both security and system usability. You should create a user account for every employee who will interact with Odoo. However, not every user needs access to all information. A baker, for example, does not need to view sensitive financial reports, and a cashier primarily needs access to the POS interface.[19]

Configuring access rights correctly serves two purposes. First, it secures sensitive data. Second, and equally important, it simplifies the user experience. By limiting the menus and options a user can see, you present them with a cleaner, more focused interface tailored to their specific job role. This reduces confusion, minimizes the risk of errors, and significantly improves user adoption—a key factor for a successful project.[11, 14]

The process involves these steps:
    1. **Create Users**: Navigate to **Settings -> Users & Companies -> Users**. Click **Create** to add a new user, providing their name and email address.
    2. **Assign Application Access**: On the user form, you will see a matrix of installed applications. You can grant access to specific applications based on the user's role. For example:
        * **Cashier**: Should only have access to "Point of Sale (User)".
        * **Baker/Production Manager**: Needs access to "Manufacturing (User)" and "Inventory (User)".
        * **Manager/Owner**: Will likely need broader access, such as "Sales (Administrator)", "Accounting (Accountant)", and full access to other key apps.

For more granular control, Odoo uses **User Groups**. Each application comes with pre-configured groups (e.g., "User" and "Administrator"). Assigning a user to the "User: Show Full Accounting Features" group, for instance, grants them more capabilities within the Accounting app than a user assigned only to "Billing". This system allows for precise control over what each user can see and do within the platform.

************************************************
Chapter 4: Managing Products and Raw Materials
************************************************

The product master is the central repository of information for everything a bakery buys, produces, and sells. A well-structured product catalog is the backbone of an effective ERP system, as this data is used by the Inventory, Purchase, Manufacturing, Sales, and POS applications. This chapter details how to create and configure raw materials, finished goods, and product variants.

4.1 Creating Raw Materials (Ingredients)
=========================================

First, create a product record for every ingredient used in the bakery, from bulk items like flour and sugar to specialty items like vanilla extract and chocolate chips.

Navigate to **Inventory -> Products -> Products** and click **Create**. When creating an ingredient, pay close attention to the following fields on the product form:

    *   **Product Name**: A clear, descriptive name (e.g., "All-Purpose Flour").
    *   **Product Type**: This must be set to **Storable Product**. This tells Odoo to track the inventory quantity for this item.[20]
    *   **Unit of Measure (UoM)**: This is the unit used for inventory and production (e.g., kg, g, L).
    *   **Purchase Unit of Measure**: This is the unit in which you buy the ingredient from your supplier. For example, you might purchase flour in a "25kg Bag" but use it in recipes in "grams". Odoo can handle the conversion automatically if the UoMs are configured in the same category.[21, 22]
    *   **Purchase Tab**: Under this tab, you can add a list of **Vendors**. By specifying the supplier and their price for the ingredient, you can streamline the purchasing process, as Odoo will automatically suggest this vendor when creating a purchase order.[23]

.. image:: /images/chapter4/raw_material_form.png
   :alt: Product form for a raw material like 'Flour', showing key fields.

4.2 Creating Finished Goods
============================

Next, create product records for all the items you sell to customers, such as croissants, sourdough loaves, and custom cakes. These are the products that will appear on your POS screen and in your online store.

When creating a finished good, the following configurations are essential:

    *   **Product Name**: The customer-facing name of the product (e.g., "Sourdough Loaf").
    *   **Product Type**: This should also be set to **Storable Product** if you produce items for stock. If an item is baked strictly to order, it could be set as a consumable, but storable is generally recommended for bakeries.
    *   **Routes**: In the **Inventory** tab, the **Routes** configuration determines the product's workflow. For a baked good, you should select both **Manufacture** and **Buy**. Selecting "Manufacture" tells Odoo that this product is created internally using a Bill of Materials. Selecting "Buy" tells Odoo that this product can be sold.[22]
    *   **Sales Price**: Set the retail price in the **General Information** tab.
    *   **Point of Sale Tab**: This tab contains settings specific to the POS. Ensure **Available in POS** is checked. If the item is sold by weight (e.g., a rustic loaf), check **To Weigh With Scale**.[24]

4.3 Configuring Product Categories
==================================

Product categories are a powerful organizational tool that impacts multiple areas of Odoo. Taking the time to create a logical category structure will improve efficiency and user experience across the system. Categories can be managed under **Inventory -> Configuration -> Product Categories**.

A well-designed category structure provides benefits in several key areas:
    *   **Point of Sale**: In the POS interface, products are grouped by their category. A logical structure (e.g., "Breads," "Pastries," "Cakes," "Drinks") allows cashiers to navigate the screen quickly and efficiently, speeding up the checkout process, which is especially important during peak hours.[5]
    *   **eCommerce**: On the online store, product categories are used to build the main navigation menu and filtering options. This helps customers easily find what they are looking for, improving the online shopping experience and increasing conversion rates.[25]
    *   **Reporting & Analytics**: Sales reports can be grouped by category, allowing you to easily identify which types of products are your best sellers.
    *   **Accounting**: Product categories can be linked to specific income and expense accounts, automating the financial posting of sales and inventory valuation.

Because of this multi-purpose functionality, establishing a clear and comprehensive category tree at the beginning of the implementation is a high-leverage activity that pays dividends in usability and reporting accuracy down the line.

4.4 Advanced: Setting Up Product Variants
==========================================

Many bakery products are not uniform; they come with options. A celebration cake, for instance, might be available in different sizes, flavors, and with various frosting choices. Instead of creating dozens of separate products (e.g., "8-inch Chocolate Cake," "8-inch Vanilla Cake," "10-inch Chocolate Cake"), Odoo's product variants feature allows you to manage all these combinations under a single product template.

The configuration process is as follows:
    1.  **Enable Variants**: First, you must enable the feature. Navigate to **Point of Sale -> Configuration -> Settings** and check the box for **Variants**.[24]
    2.  **Create Attributes**: Go to **Point of Sale -> Configuration -> Attributes**. Here, you will define the types of options available. For a cake, you might create an attribute called "Size" and another called "Flavor".[24]
    3.  **Define Attribute Values**: For each attribute, define the possible values. For the "Size" attribute, the values could be "8-inch," "10-inch," and "12-inch." For "Flavor," they could be "Chocolate," "Vanilla," and "Strawberry".[24]
    4.  **Assign Attributes to a Product**: Create a new product (e.g., "Celebration Cake"). In the **Attributes & Variants** tab, add the "Size" and "Flavor" attributes. After adding the attributes and their values, save the product template. Odoo will automatically generate all possible unique combinations as product variants.[24, 26]
    5.  **Configure Variant Pricing**: You can set a price uplift for specific attribute values. For example, the 10-inch cake might cost an additional $10, and the 12-inch might cost an additional $20 compared to the base price of the 8-inch cake. This is done by clicking the **Configure** button next to the attribute on the product form and entering the extra price for each value.[24, 26]

When this product is selected in the POS or on the eCommerce site, the user or customer will be prompted to choose from the available options, and the price will adjust automatically.

Part 3: From Purchase to Production
####################################

************************************************
Chapter 5: Procurement and Supplier Management
************************************************

Effective procurement is the foundation of a successful bakery. Ensuring a consistent supply of high-quality raw materials at the right price is critical. Odoo's Purchase application streamlines the entire procurement process, from managing supplier information to receiving and paying for goods.

5.1 Setting Up Vendors and Purchase Pricelists
===============================================

The first step is to create a complete record for every supplier the bakery works with. Navigate to the **Purchase** app and click on **Orders -> Vendors**. Click **Create** to add a new vendor, filling in their contact details and payment information.

To streamline the ordering process, you can configure vendor pricelists. On the product form for a raw material (e.g., "All-Purpose Flour"), go to the **Purchase** tab. Here, you can add a line under the **Vendors** section, selecting a supplier and entering the price they charge for that specific item. If you have multiple suppliers for the same ingredient, Odoo will use the first one in the list as the default when generating a purchase order. This feature saves time and reduces the risk of data entry errors during procurement.[27]

5.2 The Purchase-to-Pay Workflow
=================================

The standard procurement workflow in Odoo is a structured process designed for clarity and control. It moves from a draft request to a confirmed order, followed by receipt of goods and payment of the bill.

    1.  **Create a Request for Quotation (RFQ)**: The process begins by creating an RFQ in the **Purchase** app. Select the vendor, add the products (ingredients) you wish to order, and specify the quantities. At this stage, it is simply a draft document.[27]
    2.  **Confirm Order**: Once you are ready to place the order, click the **Confirm Order** button. The RFQ's status changes to **Purchase Order (PO)**, and it becomes a legally binding document. You can then send the PO to your vendor directly from Odoo via email.
    3.  **Receive Products**: When the supplier delivers the goods, a **Receipt** button will be visible on the PO. Clicking this will take you to the corresponding incoming shipment record in the Inventory app. Here, you will verify the quantities received.
    4.  **Create Bill**: After receiving the goods and the supplier's invoice, you can create a vendor bill directly from the PO. This ensures that the bill is accurately matched to the goods and prices that were ordered. The bill is then managed in the Accounting app for payment.

.. image:: /images/chapter5/purchase_order_flow.png
   :alt: Diagram of the Odoo Purchase Order workflow from RFQ to Bill.

5.3 Receiving and Verifying Raw Material Shipments
====================================================

The physical receipt of goods is a critical inventory transaction. When a delivery arrives from a supplier, the warehouse staff will process it in the **Inventory** app. They will find the incoming transfer that corresponds to the purchase order and validate the quantities received against what was ordered. Upon validation, Odoo automatically increases the on-hand stock levels for those raw materials, making them available for production.[21]

Once the receipt is validated, the accounting department can proceed with creating the vendor bill from the purchase order. This bill will then enter the accounts payable workflow, where it will be approved and scheduled for payment according to the agreed-upon terms with the supplier.[18]

*********************************************************
Chapter 6: Advanced Inventory Management for Perishables
*********************************************************

For a bakery, inventory management goes far beyond simply counting stock. The perishable nature of both raw ingredients and finished products means that effective inventory control is essential for minimizing waste, ensuring food safety, and maximizing profitability. This chapter covers the advanced Odoo Inventory features that are critical for any food business.

6.1 Warehouse and Location Setup
================================

Odoo's inventory system allows you to model the physical layout of your bakery's storage areas. By default, Odoo creates one warehouse with a standard stock location (WH/Stock). However, you can create a more granular structure to reflect your actual operations. Navigate to **Inventory -> Configuration -> Locations** to create locations such as:
    *   WH/Stock/Dry Goods
    *   WH/Stock/Refrigeration
    *   WH/Stock/Freezer

This detailed location structure helps staff know exactly where to find ingredients and allows for more precise inventory tracking.[21]

6.2 Enabling and Using Lot Tracking and Expiration Dates
=========================================================

Traceability is not an optional feature for a food business; it is a fundamental requirement for quality control and food safety. Odoo's lot tracking capability allows you to trace a batch of ingredients from the moment it is received from a supplier, through the manufacturing process, and all the way to the final sale. This is invaluable in the event of a product recall.

The configuration process is straightforward:
    1.  **Enable Features**: Go to **Inventory -> Configuration -> Settings**. In the **Traceability** section, check the boxes for **Lots & Serial Numbers** and **Expiration Dates**.[28]
    2.  **Configure Products**: For each perishable product (both raw materials like cream and finished goods like cakes), open its product form. Go to the **Inventory** tab and set the **Tracking** field to **By Lots**.[29]
    3.  **Set Expiration Times**: On the same tab, under the **Dates** section, you can define the product's shelf life. For example, for "Fresh Cream," you might set the **Expiration Time** to 7 days. This tells Odoo to automatically calculate the expiration date as 7 days from the date of receipt.[28]

With this configuration in place, whenever you receive a shipment of a tracked item, Odoo will require the user to enter a **Lot Number** (which can be the supplier's batch number or one you generate internally) and will automatically suggest an expiration date. This creates a complete traceability record for every batch of perishable goods.[28]

6.3 Configuring Removal Strategies: First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO)
====================================================================

To minimize waste, it is crucial that the ingredients closest to their expiration date are used first. Manually tracking this can be tedious and prone to error. Odoo automates this critical process through **Removal Strategies**.

The most important strategy for a bakery is **First-Expired-First-Out (FEFO)**. By applying this strategy to your stock locations, you instruct Odoo to always suggest picking the lot of an ingredient that has the earliest expiration date. For example, when a baker starts a manufacturing order for croissants, Odoo will automatically reserve the batch of butter that is set to expire soonest, ensuring it gets used before it spoils.[30, 31]

To configure this, navigate to **Inventory -> Configuration -> Locations**. Select the location where your perishable ingredients are stored (e.g., WH/Stock/Refrigeration) and set its **Removal Strategy** to **First Expired, First Out (FEFO)**.[31, 32] This simple configuration automates a vital business process that directly impacts the bakery's bottom line by reducing waste.

6.4 Automating Replenishment with Reordering Rules
====================================================

Preventing stock-outs of key ingredients is essential to keep production running smoothly. Odoo's **reordering rules** automate the replenishment process by monitoring stock levels and triggering purchase orders when quantities fall below a predefined minimum.[5]

For each critical ingredient, you can set up a reordering rule under **Inventory -> Configuration -> Reordering Rules**. The key fields are:
    *   **Product**: The ingredient to monitor.
    *   **Min Quantity**: The minimum stock level. When the forecasted quantity drops below this number, the rule is triggered.
    *   **Max Quantity**: The desired stock level to replenish to.

For example, you could set a rule for "Yeast" with a minimum of 1kg and a maximum of 5kg. If a production order consumes yeast and the forecasted stock drops to 0.9kg, Odoo will automatically create a draft Request for Quotation (RFQ) for the default vendor for 4.1kg of yeast, bringing the stock back up to the maximum level.[20, 33] This ensures you never run out of essential items unexpectedly.

**************************************************************
Chapter 7: Manufacturing: Managing Your Recipes and Production
**************************************************************

This chapter focuses on the heart of the bakery's operations: the transformation of raw ingredients into finished products. Odoo's Manufacturing application, also known as Material Requirements Planning (MRP), provides the tools to digitize recipes, manage production workflows, calculate costs accurately, and plan baking schedules efficiently.

7.1 Introduction to Odoo Manufacturing (MRP)
=============================================

Odoo's Manufacturing app is built around a few core concepts that work together to manage the production process [27, 34]:
    *   **Bill of Materials (BoM)**: This is the digital version of a recipe. It lists all the raw material components and the exact quantities needed to produce a specific finished product.
    *   **Work Centers**: These represent the different production stations in your bakery, such as a "Mixing Station," "Oven," or "Decorating Station."
    *   **Routings**: A routing defines the sequence of operations (steps) required to make a product, specifying which work center is used for each step and how long it should take.
    *   **Manufacturing Order (MO)**: This is the document that authorizes and tracks the production of a specific quantity of a product. It consumes the raw materials from the BoM and adds the finished goods to inventory.

7.2 Creating Recipes as Bills of Materials (BoMs)
===================================================

The first step in setting up manufacturing is to create a Bill of Materials for every product you bake. Navigate to **Manufacturing -> Products -> Bills of Materials** and click **Create**.

When creating a BoM, you will specify:
    *   **Product**: The finished good this BoM is for (e.g., "Sourdough Loaf").
    *   **Quantity**: The number of units of the finished product that this recipe yields (typically "1").
    *   **Components**: In the **Components** tab, you will add a line for each raw material (ingredient) required. For each component, you specify the product and the quantity needed to produce the yield defined above.[35, 36]

A well-defined BoM is the foundation for accurate inventory consumption and product costing. When you produce a Sourdough Loaf using this BoM, Odoo will automatically deduct the specified quantities of flour, water, salt, and starter from your inventory.

7.3 Managing BoMs for Products with Variants
============================================

Many bakery items, like cakes, are sold in different sizes or flavors. Instead of creating a separate BoM for every single variant, Odoo provides a more efficient method to manage this complexity within a single BoM.

This approach leverages the `Apply on Variants` field. Imagine a "Celebration Cake" product with a "Size" attribute (8", 10", 12"). The ingredients are the same, but the quantities change with the size.
    1.  Create one BoM for the main "Celebration Cake" product template.
    2.  In the **Components** tab, add the ingredient lines for the 8-inch version (e.g., 500g Flour). In the `Apply on Variants` column for these lines, select the "Size: 8-inch" variant.
    3.  Add another set of ingredient lines for the 10-inch version (e.g., 750g Flour). In the `Apply on Variants` column for these lines, select the "Size: 10-inch" variant.
    4.  Repeat for the 12-inch version.

Now, you have a single "super BoM" that contains the recipe for all variants. When you create a Manufacturing Order for a specific variant (e.g., a 10-inch cake), Odoo will intelligently pull only the component lines that are designated for that specific variant.[26] This method is far more efficient to maintain than managing dozens of separate BoMs; if an ingredient in the frosting recipe changes, you only need to update it in one place.

7.4 The Production Workflow
===========================

The daily production process is managed through Manufacturing Orders (MOs).
    1.  **Create MO**: To start production, go to **Manufacturing -> Operations -> Manufacturing Orders** and click **Create**. Select the product to be manufactured (e.g., "Croissant") and the quantity. Odoo will automatically load the corresponding BoM.
    2.  **Check Availability**: Odoo will show you if you have enough raw materials in stock to complete the order. If not, you can directly trigger a purchase order.
    3.  **Plan & Produce**: Once confirmed, the MO is ready for production. The bakers follow the steps outlined in the MO's Work Orders (e.g., mixing, proofing, baking). As they complete each step, they can track their progress in the system, either from a desktop or a tablet on the shop floor.
    4.  **Mark as Done**: When the baking is complete, clicking **Mark as Done** on the MO will trigger the inventory moves: Odoo consumes the raw materials from stock and adds the specified quantity of finished croissants to your on-hand inventory, making them available for sale.[37, 38]

7.5 Planning Production with the Master Production Schedule (MPS)
==================================================================

For bakeries with more complex scheduling needs, the Master Production Schedule (MPS) provides a high-level planning interface. Found under **Manufacturing -> Planning -> Master Production Schedule**, the MPS allows you to plan production over a period (days, weeks, or months). It considers forecasted demand from sales forecasts and actual demand from confirmed sales orders to help you decide what quantities of each product need to be baked and when. This helps in optimizing the use of critical resources like oven time and skilled bakers, ensuring you can meet demand without overproducing.[27, 39]

Part 4: Sales Channels and Customer Management
##############################################

*************************************************************
Chapter 8: The Heart of the Bakery: Point of Sale (POS) Setup
*************************************************************

The Point of Sale is the primary interface for customer interaction in most bakeries. An efficient, reliable, and easy-to-use POS system is critical for providing excellent customer service and ensuring smooth operations, especially during busy periods. Odoo's POS is fully integrated with inventory and accounting, providing a seamless flow of information from the front counter to the back office.

8.1 Configuring Your POS Interface and Hardware
===============================================

The first step is to create a POS profile for your shop. Navigate to **Point of Sale -> Configuration -> Point of Sale** and create a new record for your bakery. Here you can define various settings, such as whether it is a bar/restaurant (which enables table management) or a standard shop.[40]

The main POS screen is organized by product categories. As configured in Chapter 4, these categories will appear as tabs, allowing cashiers to quickly find items.[5] You can also connect essential hardware to your POS system, including:
    *   **Receipt Printers**: For printing customer receipts.
    *   **Cash Drawers**: That open automatically upon a cash transaction.
    *   **Barcode Scanners**: To quickly add packaged items to an order.
    *   **Scales**: For items sold by weight.[1, 41]

8.2 Setting Up Payment Methods
==============================

You must configure all the payment methods your bakery accepts. This is done under **Point of Sale -> Configuration -> Payment Methods**. You can create methods for:
    *   **Cash**: The most common method.
    *   **Credit/Debit Cards**: For card payments.
    *   **Customer Account**: For wholesale customers who pay on account.

A critical step in this configuration is linking each payment method to an **Accounting Journal**. For example, the "Cash" payment method should be linked to your "Cash Journal," and the "Credit Card" method should be linked to your "Bank Journal." This ensures that when a payment is processed in the POS, the transaction is recorded correctly in your financial books, automating a significant portion of your bookkeeping.[42, 43, 44, 45]

8.3 Managing a POS Session
==========================

The daily workflow for a cashier is managed within a POS session.
    1.  **Open Session**: At the start of the day, the cashier opens a new session from the POS dashboard. They will be prompted to enter the starting cash amount in the drawer (the opening cash balance).
    2.  **Process Orders**: Throughout the day, the cashier adds products to the cart, selects a customer if applicable, and proceeds to the payment screen to accept payment.
    3.  **Cash In/Out**: If cash needs to be added or removed from the drawer during the day (e.g., for a petty cash expense), the cashier can use the "Cash In/Out" feature to record the transaction.
    4.  **Close Session**: At the end of the day, the cashier closes the session. They will be prompted to count the cash in the drawer. Odoo will then display a closing summary, showing the total sales by payment method and any expected cash difference. Upon closing, all transactions are posted to the accounting journals.[46]

8.4 Advanced POS: Loyalty Programs, Promotions, and Custom Orders
===================================================================

Odoo's POS can be extended to handle more advanced retail scenarios common in bakeries.
    *   **Loyalty Programs**: Encourage repeat business by creating a loyalty program under **Point of Sale -> Configuration -> Loyalty Programs**. You can set up rules to award customers points for their purchases, which they can later redeem for rewards or discounts.[5, 47]
    *   **Promotions & Discounts**: Easily create promotions like "10% off all pastries on Tuesdays" or "Buy a coffee, get a croissant for $1" using the **Promotions** feature. These discounts are applied automatically at the POS when the conditions are met.[48]
    *   **Custom Orders**: Bakeries frequently handle special requests, such as writing "Happy Birthday" on a cake or accommodating a dietary restriction (e.g., "no nuts").[49] While Odoo's standard POS can handle predefined options using product variants, it is less suited for unique, one-off requests. For bakeries that do a significant amount of custom cake orders, it is highly recommended to use a specialized third-party module from the Odoo App Store. Modules like "Odoo POS Order Customization" allow cashiers to add notes to specific order lines or answer a series of questions (e.g., "What message to write on the cake?"). These notes can be printed on the kitchen receipt, ensuring the bakers have the correct instructions, and can even add an upcharge for the customization.[50, 51]

*****************************************************
Chapter 9: Managing Wholesale and Catering Orders
*****************************************************

In addition to retail sales, many bakeries have a significant B2B business, supplying goods to local cafes, restaurants, or catering corporate events. These transactions are typically larger, may involve special pricing, and are managed through the Odoo **Sales** application rather than the POS.

9.1 The Quote-to-Cash Process for B2B Customers
================================================

The workflow for a wholesale or catering order is more formal than a retail transaction and is designed to handle negotiations and credit terms.
    1.  **Create Quotation**: The process begins in the **Sales** app by creating a quotation for the client. The quotation details the products, quantities, prices, and any specific terms.[48, 52]
    2.  **Send Quotation**: The quotation can be sent to the client directly from Odoo as a professional-looking PDF. Clients can even view and approve the quotation online through a customer portal link.
    3.  **Confirm to Sales Order**: Once the client accepts the quotation, it is confirmed into a **Sales Order**. This action is the trigger for the fulfillment process. Odoo automatically creates a **Delivery Order** in the Inventory app to schedule the shipment of goods and prepares a draft **Invoice** in the Accounting app.[53]
    4.  **Deliver & Invoice**: The bakery staff will process the delivery order to ship the goods. The invoice can then be sent to the client for payment according to the agreed-upon terms (e.g., Net 30 days).

9.2 Creating and Managing Wholesale Pricelists
===============================================

Wholesale customers typically receive preferential pricing compared to retail customers. Odoo's **Pricelists** feature automates this. You can create a "Wholesale Pricelist" that applies a specific discount (e.g., 20% off the public price) or sets fixed prices for certain items.

This pricelist can then be assigned to your wholesale customer's contact record. When you create a new quotation for that customer, Odoo will automatically apply the wholesale pricelist, ensuring that the pricing is always accurate and consistent without requiring manual adjustments by the sales staff.[48]

**************************************************************
Chapter 10: Building Your Online Bakery: Website and eCommerce
**************************************************************

An online presence is essential for the modern bakery, providing an additional sales channel and a platform to showcase products. Odoo's integrated **Website** and **eCommerce** applications allow you to build and manage a professional online store that is directly connected to your inventory and order management systems.

10.1 Using the Odoo Website Builder
====================================

Odoo's website builder is designed to be incredibly user-friendly, allowing you to create a beautiful website without writing a single line of code. It uses a drag-and-drop interface with pre-designed building blocks. You can easily add text blocks, image galleries, contact forms, and more. Odoo even offers an AI-based website generator that can create an initial design for you based on your industry and preferred style.[5, 21, 54, 55]

10.2 Configuring Products for Online Sales
===========================================

Any product created in Odoo can be sold online with a single click. On the product form, simply switch the **Published** toggle in the top right corner. The product will then appear in your online store.

For products with variants, such as cakes with different sizes and flavors, the product configurator will automatically appear on the eCommerce product page. This allows customers to select their desired options before adding the item to their cart, with the price updating in real-time based on their selections.[5] This provides a seamless online experience that is directly linked to the same product variant structure used in the POS.

10.3 Setting Up Online Payment Acquirers
=========================================

To accept payments online, you need to integrate with one or more payment gateways. Odoo supports a wide range of payment acquirers out of the box, including major providers like Stripe and PayPal.

Configuration is done under **Website -> Configuration -> Payment Acquirers**. You will need to enter your account credentials for the chosen provider. Once enabled, the payment option will appear on your website's checkout page, allowing customers to pay securely with their credit cards.[5, 21, 56, 57]

10.4 Managing Online Orders: Click-and-Collect and Local Delivery
===================================================================

A key advantage of Odoo's integrated eCommerce is the ability to offer flexible fulfillment options that are connected to your inventory system.
    *   **Click-and-Collect**: This is a popular option for bakeries. You can configure a "Pick up in Store" shipping method in the **Website** app under **Configuration -> Shipping Methods**. When a customer selects this option at checkout, no shipping fee is applied, and a delivery order is created in your inventory system for internal tracking, so your staff knows to prepare the order for customer pickup.[5, 12]
    *   **Local Delivery**: For bakeries that offer home delivery, you can set up shipping methods with fixed or rule-based pricing (e.g., based on weight or order total). Odoo also has connectors for major shipping carriers like DHL and FedEx, which can calculate shipping rates in real-time and print shipping labels.[5] For food-specific delivery, Odoo can integrate with third-party delivery platforms like Uber Eats, DoorDash, and Zomato through connectors like UrbanPiper. This allows orders from these platforms to flow directly into your Odoo system, streamlining the entire online delivery process.[58, 59, 60]

Part 5: Financial Control and Business Intelligence
####################################################

*********************************************
Chapter 11: Integrated Accounting and Finance
*********************************************

The ultimate benefit of an integrated ERP system is a single, real-time view of your company's financial health. Because Odoo's **Accounting** application is connected to all operational apps (Sales, POS, Purchase, Inventory), most financial transactions are recorded automatically, drastically reducing manual bookkeeping efforts and providing accurate financial data.

11.1 Customer Invoicing and Payments
=====================================

Every sale, whether through the POS, a wholesale Sales Order, or an eCommerce order, generates the necessary financial entries. The workflow includes:
    *   **Invoice Creation**: Invoices are created automatically from confirmed sales orders or can be generated from POS sessions.
    *   **Payment Registration**: When a customer pays an invoice (either at the POS, online, or via a bank transfer for a wholesale order), the payment is registered in Odoo and reconciled against the corresponding invoice.
    *   **Follow-up**: Odoo can automatically send payment reminders for overdue wholesale invoices, improving cash flow.[18]

11.2 Managing Vendor Bills and Expenses
========================================

The accounts payable process is also streamlined:
    *   **Vendor Bills**: As described in Chapter 5, vendor bills are created from purchase orders and validated in the Accounting app. You can set up payment schedules and process batch payments to suppliers.
    *   **Employee Expenses**: If employees incur costs on behalf of the bakery (e.g., a delivery driver purchasing fuel), they can submit an expense report through the **Expenses** app. Once approved, this creates the necessary journal entries for reimbursement and cost tracking.[61]

11.3 Bank Reconciliation
========================

To ensure your books are always accurate, Odoo's bank reconciliation feature is essential. You can configure a direct link to your bakery's bank account, which will automatically import bank statement lines into Odoo every day.

The reconciliation process, found in the **Accounting** dashboard, presents a simple interface where you can match imported bank transactions (e.g., an incoming payment from a wholesale client) against open invoices in Odoo. For recurring transactions like bank fees, you can create reconciliation models to automate the matching process. This keeps your financial records perfectly aligned with your bank statements with minimal manual effort.[18, 62]

************************************************
Chapter 12: Reporting and Analytics for Growth
************************************************

With all operational and financial data centralized in one system, a bakery can move beyond simple bookkeeping and leverage its data for strategic insights and growth. Odoo provides a powerful suite of reporting and dashboarding tools to analyze performance across the entire business.

12.1 Using Standard Reports
===========================

Odoo comes with a wide range of pre-built reports that provide valuable insights out of the box. Key reports for a bakery include:
    *   **Sales Analysis Report**: Found in the **Sales** app, this report allows you to pivot and group your sales data by various dimensions. You can easily see your top-selling products, your most valuable customers, or sales performance by cashier.[41]
    *   **POS Orders Report**: This provides a detailed breakdown of all transactions that have gone through the Point of Sale.
    *   **Inventory Reports**: The Inventory app offers crucial reports like **Stock Valuation** (showing the financial value of your current inventory) and **Product Moves** (providing a detailed history of every stock movement for traceability).
    *   **Production Analysis**: In the **Manufacturing** app, this report helps you track production efficiency, analyze the cost of goods produced, and monitor scrap rates.

12.2 Creating Custom Dashboards for Bakery KPIs
================================================

While standard reports are powerful, a custom dashboard provides an at-a-glance, real-time view of the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that matter most to your specific bakery. Generic reports are useful, but a dashboard tailored to the bakery's unique operational drivers enables faster and more effective decision-making.

A bakery owner needs to monitor several key metrics daily: total sales, ingredient costs, production waste, and best-selling items.[6] Navigating through multiple reports in different applications to gather this information is inefficient. Odoo's customizable dashboards allow you to pull data from any module into a single, consolidated view.[63]

By creating a "Bakery Operations Dashboard," the owner can add cards and graphs for critical KPIs, such as:
    *   A KPI card showing "Today's POS Sales" (from Point of Sale).
    *   A bar chart of the "Top 5 Selling Products this Week" (from Sales).
    *   A KPI card for "Scrap Value this Month" (from Manufacturing).
    *   A pie chart showing "Purchases by Ingredient Category" (from Purchase).

This provides a 360-degree view of the business on one screen, updated in real-time. For even more advanced analytics, third-party apps from the Odoo store, such as Dashboard Ninja, can provide pre-built templates and AI-driven insights to help identify trends and opportunities.[6]

12.3 Financial Reporting
========================

Ultimately, all operational activities culminate in financial results. Odoo's **Accounting** app provides the standard financial statements required to understand the bakery's overall profitability and financial position. Under **Reporting**, you can generate the following core reports at any time:
    *   **Profit & Loss Statement (P&L)**: This report shows your revenues and expenses over a specific period, revealing the bakery's profitability.
    *   **Balance Sheet**: This provides a snapshot of the bakery's assets, liabilities, and equity at a single point in time, indicating its overall financial health.
    *   **Cash Flow Statement**: This report tracks the movement of cash from operating, investing, and financing activities.

These reports are generated automatically from the transactions recorded across the entire Odoo system, providing managers and owners with the accurate, up-to-date financial information they need to steer the business toward sustainable growth.[17, 18, 63]
